## Description:
The folder contains parameter files necessary for the correct functioning of GROMACS.  
<sup> (They will be reported in the same orderin which they are used to produce a trajectory). <sup>
#### ions.mdp
The parameters in this file are used to introduce counterions into the system in order to neutralize the charges.
#### minim.mdp
The parameters in this file are used for calculating the energy minimization of the system.
#### nvt.mdp
The parameters in this file are used for the first phase of system equilibration.
#### npt.mdp
The parameters in this file are used for the second phase of system equilibration.
#### md.mdp
The parameters in this file are used for molecular dynamics simulation.
