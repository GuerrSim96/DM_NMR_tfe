## Description:
In this folder, there are the OPLS-aa force field files containing the parameters for trifluoroethanol (TFE) and the protein data bank files necessary for the simulation in a mixture of TFE and water.
#### atomtypes.atp
In this file the identification codes of the atoms are associated with the corresponding atomic masses.  
The data is associated with the OPLS-aa force field.
#### ffbonded.itp
This file contains information related to bond lengths, bond angles, dihedrals, and force constants.  
The data is associated with the OPLS-aa force field.
#### ffnonbonded.itp
This file contains information on the chemical-physical properties of atoms, which are fundamental for non-bonded interactions.  
The data is associated with the OPLS-aa force field.
#### residuetypes.dat
This input file presents a list of residues identified with a variable-length code. Each identifier is accompanied by a description specifying the nature of the compound.
#### tip3p_added.pdb
This file presents the coordinates of a single water molecule.
#### trifluoroethanol.itp
This files are described respectively in the file chemical-physical properties of TFE molecule.  
The data is associated with the OPLS-aa force field.
#### trifluoroethanol.pdb
